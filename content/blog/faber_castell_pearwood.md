Thanks for reading. This will be my first ever review of a fountain pen. I hope it
is usefull in helping you decide to either buy this version of the Ambition or not.

The Faber-Castell Ambition Pearwood is not my first fountain pen but it is one
of the expensive ones that I&#39;ve bought recently. In Australia this pen costs
around $200-$150 but online on ebay or [cultpens](https://www.cultpens.com) you can get it at a cheaper price.
It also comes with a Faber-Castell branded converter so you dont need to buy one.

It&#39;s been in my daily usage and at the moment inked with Iroshizuku Yama-guri.
When I first bought it I had it inked with Diamine Oxblood as I like to colour match the body of the fountain pen with the ink.

## The Nib

The Ambition Pearwood has a Stainless steel medium nib and writes smoothly. You can also get nibs in fine, extra-fine, medium or broad. The medium nib is a bit more on the thicker side compared to other nibs but this also provides a really nice shading and line variation.

Here is another album containing a few images of the Ambition. The notebook I used for the writing sample is the Monsiuer Fountain Pen friendly notebook.
I find it hard to believe this notebook is marketed as such as with certain nibs & ink the feathering and ghosting is really noticeable.
