I have this major project at uni, to develop a web app following the whole SDLC, in a group of six. We (well the team leader) decided that we should use Ruby on Rails. Me being the "Python junkie",  i wasn't interested in Ruby. As i have had no experience in using  Django or Turbogears i couldn't suggest these, whereas the team leader has had some experience with Rails but to what extent i do not know.<br /><br />Anyway, ive been looking into Ruby and its just seems like Python. Hash's and Dictionaries. But Rails as a framework is great, to the extent that i understand so far. Which is not much. I just watched the first <a href="https://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov">screencast</a> and each time something worked the screencaster says "oops" as if it something didn't work.  Ruby...well reading <a href="https://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby</a>, is, i admit fun/different and who can resist Cartoon Foxes with who ramble on about Chunky Bacon, what else can i say?<br /><br />More to come.
