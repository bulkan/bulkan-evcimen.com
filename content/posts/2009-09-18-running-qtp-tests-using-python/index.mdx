QTP provides an interface called the **automation object model**. This **model** is essentially a COM interface providing a bunch of objects that can be used to automate QTP. The full object list is available in the **QuickTest Professional Automation** documentation.

Running QTP tests from the command line is useful for doing scheduled automatic testing. If you use a continuous integration system to do automatic builds of your software, you can run your QTP tests on the latest build.

The following is a Python script that is able to run a test and print out *Passed* or *Failed*.  It is a direct port of example code in the documentation written in VBScript

```python
import win32com, win32com.client

qtp = win32com.client.Dispatch("QuickTest.Application")

# starts up QTP
qtp.Launch() 

# make the QTP window visible
qtp.Visible = True

# Open a test, replace the path 
qtp.Open("C:\Tests\test1")

# to open a QTP test in Quality Center
# qtp.Open(r"[QualityCenter] Subject\FolderName\QTPScript")

# create a RunResultsOptions object
qtResultsOpt = win32com.client.Dispatch("QuickTest.RunResultsOptions")

# set the location to where the results will be save
qtResultsOpt.ResultsLocation = "C:\Test\test1\res"

qtp.Test.Run(qtResultsOpt)

print "Test has %s" %qtp.Test.LastRunResults.Status

# close the Test
qtp.Test.Close()

# quit QTP
qtp.Quit()
```
